## Overview

This project contains a series of open-ended requirements which describe the project you’ll be building.
There are many possible ways to correctly fulfill all of these requirements, and you should expect to use the internet, Codecademy, and other resources when you encounter a problem that you cannot easily solve.

## Project Goals

In this project, you’ll be building your own reference cheat sheet to help you build more websites in the future!
Although there are great places to learn HTML & CSS like Codecademy, the best reference for yourself is often your own notes and projects.

## Features

- A complete HTML reference cheat sheet for input types and attributes.
- Organized sections covering common HTML form elements.
- Easy-to-read examples demonstrating how to use each input type.
- Interactive testing within the browser to see how HTML inputs behave.
